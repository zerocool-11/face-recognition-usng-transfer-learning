# face-recognition-usng-transfer-learning


####  here the transfer learning means we will use a pre trained model weights and train our model using that weights it will use less resources and works effectively   for this you can use any models -
* MobileNet
* ResNet
* VGG16
#### i used VGG16 for this  first of all i used dataset.py to generate dataset of my face  


### then after that i used train.ipynb  file in order to train my model
